# Spam-Email-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
The objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model for detecting spam emails. The project involves various stages including data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation.
# Project Steps

    Data Collection and Preprocessing:
        Data Collection: Obtain a dataset of emails labeled as spam or ham (non-spam). In this project, the dataset is loaded from a CSV file.
        Text Preprocessing: Clean the email text by converting to lowercase, removing punctuation and numbers, tokenizing the text, and removing stop words.
        Feature Extraction: Convert the cleaned text into numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization.

    Data Balancing:
        Balancing the Dataset: Address the imbalance in the dataset where the number of ham emails significantly outnumbers spam emails. SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is used to balance the training data by generating synthetic samples for the minority class (spam).

    Model Training and Evaluation:
        Model Selection: Train multiple machine learning models including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest.
        Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models on the test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Select the best model based on the highest F1 score.

    Model Optimization:
        Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the best model to improve its performance using techniques such as Grid Search.

    Model Deployment:
        Creating an API: Develop a Flask API to serve the best model, allowing it to receive email text and return predictions (spam or ham).
        Containerization: Use Docker to containerize the model and the API for easy deployment and scalability.
        Orchestration: Deploy the containerized application using Kubernetes for robust and scalable production deployment.
